## üéØ Problem Statement

* In today‚Äôs fast-paced world, many individuals struggle to maintain a healthy lifestyle due to lack of personalized guidance, time constraints, and inconsistent motivation. Traditional fitness solutions often require expensive subscriptions, in-person consultations, or rigid schedules that don't adapt to personal preferences or daily routines. There is a growing need for an accessible, friendly, and intelligent virtual assistant that can provide on-demand fitness advice, healthy lifestyle suggestions, and basic nutrition guidance‚Äîall tailored to individual needs and available at any time.

## üí° Solution
* **Fitness Buddy aims to solve this problem by offering a conversational, AI-powered health and fitness coach that can:**
    * Recommend home workouts and routines based on user input.
    * Provide motivational tips and daily fitness inspiration.
    * Suggest simple, nutritious meal ideas.
    * Encourage habit-building and consistency.

## üíª Technologies Used

* **Platform:** IBM watsonx.ai Studio üé®

* **AI Model:** IBM Granite (`granite-3-3-8b-instruct`), a foundational LLM optimized for instruction-following. ü§ñ

* **Knowledge Source:** A single, well-structured `.docx` file ([`Fitness_Buddy_Knowledge_Base.docx`](Fitness_Buddy_Knowledge_Base.docx)) containing all the project's data. üìÇ

* **Data Retrieval:** A Vector Index for RAG. üîç

* **Storage:** IBM Cloud Object Storage üì¶

## ‚òÅÔ∏è IBM Cloud Services Used

* **watsonx.ai Studio:** The core development and deployment environment.

* **IBM Granite Model:** The large language model powering the agent's intelligence.

* **Watsonx Vector Index:** The service used to create and host the RAG knowledge base.

* **IBM Cloud Lite Account:** All services for this project were provisioned and utilized within the free tier. üÜì

* **IBM Cloud Object Storage:** Used for project asset storage and the knowledge base.

## ‚≠ê WOW Factors

* **RAG-Powered:** Fetches answers directly from a custom `.docx` file to ensure accuracy. üéØ

* **Built on IBM Cloud:** Entirely configured and deployed using powerful IBM watsonx tools. ‚òÅÔ∏è

* **Polite Redirection:** Handles unrelated questions gracefully, redirecting the user back to the project's focus. ü§ó

* **Holistic Wellness:** The knowledge base covers a wide range of topics: workouts, nutrition, motivation, and habits. üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

* **Level-Specific Advice:** The agent provides guidance tailored for Beginner, Intermediate, and Expert users. üìà

## üë• End Users

* **Beginners:** Individuals taking their first steps into fitness. üå±

* **Enthusiasts:** Users seeking to optimize their routine and break through plateaus. üí™

* **Everyone:** Anyone needing a digital partner for daily motivation and wellness tips. ü§ó

* **Final Presentation:** The project is ready to be showcased. üåü

## ‚úÖ Key Features

* **Custom Q&A:** Answers specific user queries based on the vectorized knowledge base. üí¨

* **LLM-Powered:** Uses an IBM Granite model for natural conversation. üó£Ô∏è

* **Built-in NLP Support:** Understands and processes natural language queries effectively.

* **Structured Advice:** Formats responses with lists, headings, and clear sections for readability. üìñ

* **Adaptive Guidance:** Provides different levels of advice (Beginner, Intermediate, Expert) when requested. üìä

* **Responds Gracefully:** Provides helpful and polite answers, even for off-topic questions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

* A user submits a query to the agent (e.g., ‚ÄúWhat's a beginner workout?‚Äù). ‚úçÔ∏è

* The IBM Granite model processes the user's request. ü§î

* The RAG system instantly searches the `Fitness_Buddy_Knowledge_Base.docx` for the most relevant information. üîç

* If the answer is not found in the document, the agent uses its web search tool to find an accurate response. üåê

* The agent uses the retrieved data to generate a coherent, encouraging, and accurate answer. ‚úÖ
